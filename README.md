# Statistics in Python  
This course introduces the basics of carrying out a statistical analysis in Python. It covers exploratory data analysis and constructing and interpreting linear and generalized linear models. Each chapter builds on the previous one, introducing progressively advanced topics while ensuring practical hands-on experience with relevant Python packages.
 
### Prerequisites
* Familiarity with Python and basic data analysis

### Learning Outcomes
o	To become familiar with the concepts of tidy data, variables, values, and observations.
o	To understand the differences between continuous and categorical variables and how to explore data structures using Python.
o	To apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to analyze variation and co-variation within datasets.
o	To utilize Python plotting functions to explore relationships between continuous and categorical variables, as well as co-variation between different variable types.
o	To construct and interpret linear models in Python, focusing on key components such as slopes, intercepts, and model fit.
o	To assess model performance using residuals, Adjusted R-squared, and AIC metrics for model comparison.
o	To understand the concepts of probability, random variables, and probability distributions, including common distributions such as Binomial, Normal, Poisson, and Negative Binomial.
