    "text": "1.1 Getting to know your data\nTo get started, let’s explore the following questions for our dataset.\n\nWhat is the structure of the data?\nWhat type of variation occurs within my variables?\nWhat type of covariation occurs between my variables?\n\n\n1.1.1 Data Structure and Data Summaries\nOne of the things we will wish to know about our variables are whether they are continuous or categorical.\n Image Credit: @AllisonHorst.\n\nContinuous variable: a variable that can take on an unlimited number of values between the lowest and highest points of measurements.\n\ne.g. speed, distance, height\n\nCategorical variable can take one of a limited subset of values. For example, if you have a dataset about a household then you will typically find variables like employment sector, marriage status, and country.\n\nIn python, categorical variables are usually stored as character strings or integers (e.g. ‘Industry’ and ‘Academia’ for types of employment sector).\nCategorical variables are nominal if they have no order (e.g. ‘Ghana’ and ‘Uruguay’)\nCategorical variables are ordinal if there is an order associated with them (e.g. ‘low’, ‘medium’, and ‘high’ referring to economic status).\n\n\nAs we start to think about our data and the types of variables we are working with, we recommend reading Chapter 4: “What Gets Counted Counts” of Data Feminism by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein. The book encourages us to rethink binaries and examine classification systems in data science.\n\n\nExercises\n\nQuestion 1 Answer\n\n\nWhat are the dimensions of the dataframe?\n\n\n\n# the shape attribute returns the dimensions of the dataframe\nsalaries.shape\n\n(100, 6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nQuestion 2Answer\n\n\nWhat are the first and last values of salary?\n\n\n\n# the head method shows us the first 5 rows\n\nsalaries.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      ids\n      department\n      bases\n      experience\n      raises\n      salary\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      sociology\n      39012.062997\n      3\n      2122.325646\n      45379.039935\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      biology\n      51872.123941\n      9\n      541.643975\n      56746.919719\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      english\n      64341.126468\n      3\n      543.178641\n      65970.662390\n    \n    \n      3\n      4\n      informatics\n      68975.266754\n      2\n      1736.946839\n      72449.160433\n    \n    \n      4\n      5\n      statistics\n      78262.278702\n      9\n      469.943148\n      82491.767032\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# the tail method shows us the last 5 rows\n\nsalaries.tail()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      ids\n      department\n      bases\n      experience\n      raises\n      salary\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      95\n      96\n      sociology\n      42107.716434\n      8\n      1957.880086\n      57770.757125\n    \n    \n      96\n      97\n      biology\n      49774.735037\n      5\n      470.338273\n      52126.426402\n    \n    \n      97\n      98\n      english\n      60919.523254\n      3\n      502.197549\n      62426.115902\n    \n    \n      98\n      99\n      informatics\n      63809.889673\n      7\n      1641.660044\n      75301.509985\n    \n    \n      99\n      100\n      statistics\n      84420.476008\n      3\n      537.931883\n      86034.271658\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nQuestion 3Answer\n\n\nWhich variables are categorical or continuous variables?

A continuous variable * A continuous variable can take any of an infinite set of ordered values (e.g. numbers and date times). We can inspect the spread of the data using a density plot or box plot.\n\n# We can use the distplot method to make a plot of the distribution.\n# We again specify the variable to plot, salary.\n# We can customise the plot using several parameters\n# to include a histogram or not, e.g. hist=False\n# to plot a Gaussian kernel density e.g. kde=True\n# to customise the appearance of the plot, kde_kws,\n# including keyword arguments for underlying plotting functions like shade.\n\nsalary_all_distplot = sns.distplot(salaries['salary'],\n                                   hist=False,\n                                   kde=True,\n                                   kde_kws={'shade': True,\n                                            'linewidth': 3})\n\n# We can then set the xlabel and ylabel for the plot using the method set()\n\nsalary_all_distplot.set(xlabel='Salary',\n                        ylabel='Density');\n\nC:\\Users\\paudyp\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_19120\\3695421610.py:9: UserWarning: \n\n`distplot` is a deprecated function and will be removed in seaborn v0.14.0.\n\nPlease adapt your code to use either `displot` (a figure-level function with\nsimilar flexibility) or `kdeplot` (an axes-level function for kernel density plots).\n\nFor a guide to updating your code to use the new functions, please see\nhttps://gist.github.com/mwaskom/de44147ed2974457ad6372750bbe5751\n\n  salary_all_distplot = sns.distplot(salaries['salary'],\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at the distribution of salary, something interesting seems to be happening.

Does it vary by department?\n\n\n\n# From the plot it looks like there is a positive relationship between the salary an individual receives and the years of experience they have. That is as the years of experience they have increases the salary also increases. \n\n# While the relationships looks positive within departments, the strength of the relationships look different for each department. \n\n\n\n\nLet’s use a model to capture the pattern and make it more explicit.

It is difficult to tell by eye which line fits the data better. We could do this ourselves, by measuring the residuals, the distance from the data (actual response) to the line (predicted response), for each model, and comparing them. But this can be time-consuming, especially if our goal is to find the best model which could involve looking at more than just two models!\nLuckily python has built-in functions that will explore all the possibilities to find the ‘best’ line. In linear regression, one of the ways to define the ‘best’ line is by finding the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (aka sum of squares).\nCalculating the sum of squared residuals involves taking the residual distances, squaring them, and summing them. This approach is also called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), after which the OLS function in python takes its name."

The predicted value (our line of best fit) are sometimes over and underestimating faculty salaries by as much as 20,000 dollars. \n\n\n\n\nResiduals\nWe can get the residuals by substracting the observed values (actual salaries) from the predicted values (predicted salaries) from our line of best fit. This can be plotted by plotting the predicted line, the actual data/salaries.\n\nfig, ax2 = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))\n\n\n# Plot\n\n## The data\nx = salaries[\"experience\"]\ny = salaries[\"salary\"]\n\n## The fitted line\n\nslope = results_mod1.params['experience']\nintercept = results_mod1.params['Intercept']\n\nxfit = np.arange(10)\nyfit = slope * xfit + intercept\n\n# plot data\nax2.scatter(x, y, marker='x', color='k')\n\n# plot line of best fit\nax2.plot(xfit, yfit, color='r')\n\n\n# plot residuals\n\n# The function below creates a vector of the x values and y values \n# for the predicted and actual data. These will be used to create the error lines.\n\ndef residual_line(x, y, slope, intercept):\n    xs = [x, x] # x values (experience) for the real and predicted salaries\n    ys = [y, (intercept + slope * x)] # y values (salary) for the real and predicted salaries.\n    return xs, ys\n\n# Creating the plot\n## Constructing the vertical error lines\n\n# extract residual lines\nxvalues, yvalues = residual_line(x, y, slope, intercept)\n\n# plot residual lines\nerrs = ax2.plot(xvalues, yvalues, color='0.5')\n\nax2.set_xlabel(\"Experience\", fontsize=12) # x-axis label\nax2.set_ylabel(\"Salary\", fontsize=12); # y-axis label\n\n\n\n\nWe can calculate the residuals to look at the actual vs predicted values and plot these on a graph\n\n# the actual salary\nactual = salaries[\"salary\"] \n\n# the predicted salary\npredicted = results_mod1.params['experience'] * salaries[\"experience\"] + results_mod1.params['Intercept']\n\n# difference between the actual and predicted salary\ndifference = actual - predicted\n\n# years of experience to go on the x-axis\nx = salaries[\"experience\"]\n\nfig, resid_plot = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,5))\n\nresid_plot.scatter(x, difference, marker='o', color='k')\nresid_plot.set_xlabel(\"Experience\", fontsize=12)\nresid_plot.set_ylabel(\"Residuals\", fontsize=12);\n\n\n\n\nSo what do these residuals mean? Well if we look at the residuals on the y-axis in some cases we are over and underestimating a professor’s salary by as much as 20,000 USD. For a large number of individuals we are over and underestimating their salraries between 10,000 and 20,000, which isn’t great. We will want to improve our estimates, although the level of error that is acceptable might depend on our stakeholders and how they are going to use this information.\nWe can then calculate the root mean squared error by taking the difference squared and then the square root.\n\n# To get the root mean squared error we need to take the difference squared and then the square root.\n\n# squaring the difference. This is also a convenient way\n# to get rid of the negative sign and look at how far our line of best fit is from the data,\n# regardless of whether the salary was under or overestimated.\ndifference_squared = difference**2\n\n# We then take the square root to get\n# back to the absolute values.\nresiduals = difference_squared.apply(math.sqrt)\n\n# collect all of the residuals in a sum\nresiduals.sum()\n\nnp.float64(1168916.8131155875)\n\n\nResiduals\nWe can then inspect the residuals in the model. Residuals represent the left over variation in the response variable not explained by the model. A pattern in the residuals may indicate that we are missing a variable or that our assumption of normality is incorrect. When we are looking at the residuals, we want them to form an ‘amorphous cloud’, i.e. a cloud shape with no patterns.\n\nResiduals vs Fitted: is used to check the assumptions of linearity. If the residuals are spread equally around a horizontal line without distinct patterns (red line is approximately horizontal at zero), that is a good indication of having a linear relationship.\nNormal Q-Q: is used to check the normality of residuals assumption. If the majority of the residuals follow the straight dashed line, then the assumption is fulfilled.\nScale-Location: is used to check the homoscedasticity of residuals (equal variance of residuals). If the residuals are spread randomly and you see a horizontal line with equally (randomly) spread points, then the assumption is fulfilled.\nResiduals vs Leverage: is used to identify any influential value in our dataset. Influential values are extreme values that might influence the regression results when included or excluded from the analysis. Look for cases outside of a dashed line.\n\nWe will be focusing today on residuals vs. fitted and the Normal Q-Q plot.\n\nsalaries_resid = sns.residplot(data=salaries,\n                               y='salary', \n                               x='experience',\n                               scatter_kws={'alpha':0.5})\nsalaries_resid;\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the residuals that our estimates are not great. We seem to be doing an equally poor job of under and overestimating the salaries, with slightly more salaries underestimated.\nChecking for normality of the residuals\nOne of the assumptions of a linear model is that the residuals are normally distributed. Note that this does not mean that the response variable needs to come from a normal distribution, just that the residuals (i.e. errors) are normally distributed with some below and some above with most of the residuals being only a little bit off. These values form the peak of the bell curve and are a little closer to the predicted line. Normal distributions are often referred to as bell curves because of their shape. Let’s take a look at a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.\nNormal\n\n## Inspecting the normal distribution\n\nmu = 0 # the mean, often represented by the greek letter mu.\nvariance = 1 # the variance, often represented by sigma (std deviation) squared.\n\nsigma = math.sqrt(variance)\nx = np.linspace(mu - 3*sigma, mu + 3*sigma, 100)\n\nplt.plot(x, stats.norm.pdf(x, mu, sigma))\nplt.xlabel('Value')\nplt.ylabel('Density')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWhat you’ll notice in the plot above is that it is symmetrical with most values falling close to 0, i.e. most values are not far off from the predicted values but could be a little above (positive) or below (negative). As you get further from the predicted value, the amount of data underneath the curve should be less (less values are way off).\nA common plot used to inspect model residuals is a qqplot. The qqplot compares the residuals to a theoretical normal distribution. If the residuals come from a normal distribution we would expect the blue dots to line up with the red line.\n\nresidual = results_mod1.resid\n\n# Use statsmodels qqplot to graph residuals\n# make a figure and an axis\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,7))\n\n# call the qqplot graph from statsmodels 'graphics' module.\n# fits against the normal distribution as standard.\nsm.graphics.qqplot(residual, line='45', fit=True, ax=ax);\n\n\n\n\nOur plot doesn’t look particularly good. Few of the residuals match the red line, and our qqplot plot is slightly s-shaped with more values being under and overestimated than what we would expect as part of a normal distribution. This reflects that our model is a poor fit to our data. We can see whether including department in the model helps explain some of the remaining variation in the model."

    "text": "1.2 The Exponential Family\nNow that we know how to define a probability for discrete and continuous random variables we can take a look at a few common probability distributions from the exponential family that we can use for our response variable including Normal, Binomial, Poisson, and Negative Binomial. There is a large class of generalized linear models that we can use to model these different distributions.\n\n1.2.1 Normal (Gaussian) distribution\nWe’ve already come across the normal distribution, which we use to inspect and compare our residuals. The normal distribution is arguably the most commonly used distribution in statistics. It is used for continuous variables (e.g. height, measurement error). It has several computational properties which make it easy to work with. For instance, it is symmetric, unimodal, and the mean, median, and mode are all equal. That means it can be captured just by specifying the mean and the variance.\nYou may use it to represent changes in population. Let’s say you know the population mean but wish to understand how much it varies (e.g. by +/- 10%, +/- 15%).\nBelow we have two plots of the normal distribution, where the mean is the same: 0, but with higher (5) or lower (1) variance.\n\n# Import required packages\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # data plotting\nimport seaborn as sns # data visualisation and plotting\nimport statsmodels.api as sm # statistical modelling package\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf # statistical modelling package with R-like formulas\nimport scipy.stats as stats # statistical distributions\nimport math # mathetical operations\nfrom statsmodels.genmod.generalized_linear_model import GLM # importing packages to run GLM\nfrom statsmodels.genmod import families # importing families for exponential families\nfrom pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters # additional package support for plotting with matplotlib\nfrom scipy.stats import poisson # poisson distribution\nfrom scipy.stats import binom # binomial distribution\nfrom scipy.stats import nbinom # negative binomial distribution\nfrom scipy.stats import norm # normal distribution\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2 # Chi squared statistic\nfrom IPython.display import display # Public API for display tools in IPython.\nimport warnings # warning functionality\n\n# Seaborn plot default style change\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\n# supress warnings due to different versions of packages\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)\n\n\n## Normal Distribution\n\n# A normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1\nmean = 0 # mean\nvariance = 1 # variance\nstddev = math.sqrt(variance) # standard deviation\n# random generated sample of \n# the normal distribution to plot\nnorm_1 = np.linspace(mean - 3*stddev, mean + 3*stddev, 100) # creates the range of x values\n\n# Add the normal distribution to plot object\nplt.plot(norm_1, stats.norm.pdf(norm_1, mean, stddev))\n\n# A normal distribution with mean 10 and variance 10\nmean = 10 # mean\nvariance = 10 # variance\nstddev = math.sqrt(variance) # std deviation\n\n# random generated sample of \n# the normal distribution to plot\nnorm_2 = np.linspace(mean - 3*stddev, mean + 3*stddev, 100) # creates the range of x values\n\n# Add the second normal distribution to plot object, label and show\nplt.plot(norm_2, stats.norm.pdf(norm_2, mean, stddev))\nplt.ylabel('Density')\nplt.xlabel('Value')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThe normal distribution is useful for modelling continuous data. In the earlier example, it was appropriate to assume that our response variable (salary) was normally distributed given that it is a measured continuous variable.\n\n\n1.2.2 Binomial\nThe binomial distribution applies when you have a series of trials where the outcome of the trial can only take one of two values (e.g. heads/tails, alive/dead, present/absent, or buyers/non-buyers).\nThe binomial distribution can be written as:\n\\(P(\\text{k out of n}) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\)\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of trials, \\(k\\) is the number of successes, and \\(p\\) is the probability of success.\nWe can then get the mean as \\(\\mu = np\\) and the variance is \\(\\sigma^2 = np(1-p)\\).\nIn the case where there is only one trial (e.g. one coin toss) we can use the bernoulli distribution. The bernoulli distribution is a special case of the Binomial distribution, and is used to describe an instance of the binomial distribution where there is only a single trial. So if we have one coin toss, it can only have two outcomes: heads (0) or tails (1).\n\n# Generate the possible values for the number of successes, k, \n# in this case, heads (0), tails (1). \nk = np.arange(2) \n\n# If the coin is fair, we have a 50/50 chance of \n# getting tails (1), i.e. 50% probability.\ndata_binom = binom.pmf(k, n=1, p=0.5) \n\n# Plot the results\nax_binom = sns.barplot(x=k, y=data_binom)\nax_binom.set(xlabel='Tails', ylabel='Density')\nax_binom;\n\n\n\n\nIf we have two coin tosses, we have 4 possible combinations: heads/heads, tails/heads, heads/tails, tails/tails. Which result in 3 outcomes: heads/heads (0+0=0), tails/tails (1+1 = 2) and heads/tails (0+1 = 1) (because the order doesn’t matter).\n\n# Generate the number of successes, k, \n# in this case, heads/heads (0), tails/heads (1), tails/tails (2).\nk = np.arange(3)  \n\n# If the coin is fair, \n# we have a 50/50 chance of heads or tails, i.e. 50% probability.\ndata_binom = binom.pmf(k, n=2, p=0.5) \n\n# Plot the results\nax_binom = sns.barplot(x = k, y = data_binom)\nax_binom.set(xlabel='Tails', ylabel='Density')\nax_binom;\n\n\n\n\nI may wish to know how many students in my course like statistics before I begin. I can start by asking: * What is the probability that any random student likes statistics? * 0.7? 0.8?\nI’m feeling pretty positive, there’s an 80% chance that a random student likes statistics. But what is the probability that the whole class likes statistics? I could ask: * What is the probability that all 10 students in the course like statistics? * 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 … x 0.8 = \\(0.8^{10} \\approx 0.107\\) :-(\nWe can get to this answer by multiplying the probability of each student liking statistics, in this case \\(0.8^{10}\\) which is equal to \\(\\approx 0.107\\) or 10.7% chance of all students in a class of 10 liking statistics.\n10.7% doesn’t sound very promising. But I would settle for 6-9 people out of 10 liking statistics. Of course, I won’t know the answer until I attend the course, but I can get an idea of how probable it is that 6/10 or 7/10 of you like probability by working out the probability mass function:\n\n# Generate the number of successes, k, in this case, \n# students from 0 to 10 who like the course. \nk = np.arange(11)\n\n# We can compute the probability of 0/10, 1/10... 10/10 students liking the course. \n# Where n is the number of trials (in this case the number of students).\ndata_binom = binom.pmf(k=k, n=10, p=0.8) \n\n# Plot the results\nax_binom = sns.barplot(x=k, y=data_binom)\nax_binom.set(xlabel='Successes', ylabel='Density')\nax_binom;\n\n\n\n\n\n# this is what our binomial data created looks like\ndata_binom\n\narray([1.02400000e-07, 4.09600000e-06, 7.37280000e-05, 7.86432000e-04,\n       5.50502400e-03, 2.64241152e-02, 8.80803840e-02, 2.01326592e-01,\n       3.01989888e-01, 2.68435456e-01, 1.07374182e-01])\n\n\nThe binom distribution function from scipy.stats takes n and p as shape arguments, where n is the number of trials, and p is the probability,\nIn the code above we have specified that we are asking 10 random students in each trial (n), that the probability that a student likes statistics is 0.8. From the probability mass function density plot it looks quite likely that between 6-9 students will like statistics. Hooray!\nSome examples of where we might use the binomial are to model\n\nThe number of individuals with malaria out of the number of individuals in the population (e.g. an individual can have malaria (1) or not (0))\nThe number of customers who bought item A out of total number of shop customers (a customer can have bought item A (1) or not (0))\n\nWhere the number of outcomes is greater than 2, e.g. (single, married, divorced), then we can use a multinomial distribution which allows for more than 2 possibilities. We can get our clue for the number of outcomes from the name (bi = 2, multi = multiple).\n\n\n1.2.3 Poisson\nThe Poisson distribution gives the distribution of the number of individuals, arrivals, events, counts, etc., in a given time/space/unit of counting effort.\nThis is the common distribution to use whenever things are counted and when they are discrete (e.g. you cannot have 1.5 of a person).\n\nImage Credit: Bjørn Christian Tørrissen CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe Poisson distribution expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event. For instance, we could use the Poisson distribution to model the number of cyclists crossing a bridge per day. However, the Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.\nThe Poisson distribution is given by the formula:\n\\[P(k\\ \\mathrm{events}) = \\frac{\\lambda^{k}e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\]\nWhere, \\(\\lambda\\) is the average density of the events (e.g. cyclists per day), and the function returns the likelihood of seeing \\(k\\) cyclists.\nIn the Poisson distribution, the mean and the variance are the same, which is why the poisson function takes only the mean (mu or \\(\\mu\\)) in the code below. \\(\\mu\\) is also referred to as the shape parameter in the distribution.\n\n# generate possible x values for plot representing k events.\nk = np.arange(250, step = 10)\n\n# create poisson distribution for range of x\ndata_poisson = poisson.pmf(k=k, mu=150)\n\n# plot the distribution\nax_poisson = sns.barplot(x=k, y=data_poisson)\nax_poisson.set(xlabel='Count', ylabel='Density')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90);\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before the poisson is the most common distribution we use to model counts (events, people, animals, etc.). However, we are constrained by the fact that the mean and variance are the same. This means that more counts, and as a result larger means allow for greater variation, whereas fewer counts with a smaller means allow for less variation. If we need to allow for more variation (i.e. wider distribution of counts) we can look to the negative binomial.\n\nFun Fact: One of the most famous historical, practical uses of the Poisson distribution was estimating the annual number of Prussian cavalry soldiers killed due to horse-kicks.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Negative Binomial\nThe negative binomial distribution is discrete, like the Poisson, but its variance can be larger than its mean, (i.e. it can be overdispersed). It is often used when the data largely follows a Poisson distribution but there are a large number of zeros in the data (e.g. few sightings and a large number of absences).\nIn fact, the negative binomial distribution is a generalisation of the poisson distribution, whose variance is considered separately from its mean, and hence works well when data are overdispersed. The negative binomial is usually characterised in similar terms to the binomial distribution - \\(r\\) (number of failures observed) and \\(p\\) (probability of success), with \\(k\\) now representing the probability of seeing \\(k\\) successes before \\(r\\) failures are observed given \\(p\\).\nThis is how it is done in scipy.stats, however it can also be parameterised in terms of its mean and variance. As a result, the mean and variance do not have to be equal as with the Poisson distribution, which makes it more flexible.\n\\[p = \\frac{\\sigma^{2} - \\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}\\]\n\\[r = \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{\\sigma^{2} - \\mu}\\]\nGiving the Negative Binomial distribution as:\n\\[P(X = k) = \\left(\n    \\begin{matrix}\n        k + r - 1\\\\\n        k\n    \\end{matrix}\n\\right)p^{k} \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}  \\right)^{r} \\]\nWhere:\n\\(p\\) is the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial with two outcomes (success or failure);\n\\(r\\) is the dispersion or shape parameter;\n\\(k\\) is the given number of successes of interest.\nNote that although commonly called \\(r\\), scipy refers to this parameter as \\(n\\).\nIn scipy.stats, nbinom takes n and p as shape parameters where n is the number of successes, whereas p is the probability of a single success.\nIn the code below we are showing a different approach, in this case we are generating random values from the negative binomial distribution. We are plotting on the x axis the number of successes (e.g. these could be counts of animals or numbers of people) before we get our first failure (e.g. no animal or no person detected).\nIn this case size is the number of times we run the trial. n is the number of successes before a failure, and p is the probability of a success.\n\n# generate the data from the negative binomial distribution\ndata_nbinom = nbinom.rvs(n=5, p=0.5, size=1000)\n\n# plot the distribution\nax_nbinom = sns.distplot(data_nbinom, kde=False)\n\n# add labels\nax_nbinom.set(xlabel='Negative Binomial', ylabel='Frequency')\nax_nbinom;\n\nC:\\Users\\paudyp\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_24408\\2654644825.py:5: UserWarning: \n\n`distplot` is a deprecated function and will be removed in seaborn v0.14.0.\n\nPlease adapt your code to use either `displot` (a figure-level function with\nsimilar flexibility) or `histplot` (an axes-level function for histograms).\n\nFor a guide to updating your code to use the new functions, please see\nhttps://gist.github.com/mwaskom/de44147ed2974457ad6372750bbe5751\n\n  ax_nbinom = sns.distplot(data_nbinom, kde=False)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this we can see that 4 successes before we see a failure is the most frequent value, followed by 5 successes. You’ll notice that we also get a frequency for 0 to 30 successes. We can transform these into probabilities by dividing the frequency by the size (number of trials) we ran.\nThe negative binomial, may perhaps seem a little abstract to relate the number of successes before a failure to counts, but the important information to take away is that the negative binomial can be an effective way to model count data that is overdispersed (i.e. the data has a larger variance than the mean)."

These are discrete counts, you can’t have 4.5 of a wildebeest or 5.5 bicycles crossing the Brookly bridge. Response variables with a negative binomial distribution are a bit harder to detect, but they might include outcomes where you have a lot of zeros, e.g. if you typically only see pods of whales and have a lot of instances with zero whales observed, or where the data is more variable some very high counts and some low counts. Normally distributed response variable might include measurements such as weight or height. It is typically used for continuous variables.\nExperiment with the poisson distribution. What happens when you experiment with the shape parameter, mu? We observe that the Poisson distributions are unimodal (one peak); exhibit positive skew (that decreases as mu increases); are centred roughly on mu; have variance (spread) that increases as mu increases.\nExperiment with the normal distribution. What happens when you change the variance? What happens when you change the mean? Changing the mean will shift where the normal distribution is centered. Increasing the variance will widen the distribution (more flat), decreasing the variance will tighten the distribution (more peaked)."

    "text": "1.3 Implementing Generalized Linear Models in Python\nA generalized linear model consists of 3 parts:\n\nAn exponential family probability distribution\nA linear predictor\nA link function\n\nThe exponential family probability distribution, is the probability distribution that our response variable follows, for instance, Normal, Binomial, Poisson, and Negative Binomial.\nThe linear predictor is a linear combination of a set of coefficients and explanatory variables used to predict our response variable. This is essentially the same form used to specify our linear model, which means we can use the same formula set up for our GLM.\nThe link function allows us to use the linear predictor by providing the link to connect the exponential distribution to the linear predictor. There will often be defaults for the link when you call the model family, but you can also specify this yourself. For instance, the Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution where values can take on integers between 0 and infinity. However, the linear predictor is based on the normal distribution that is continuous and can go from -infinity to infinity. It is therefore common to use a log link to log the response variable, which effectively limits the normal distribution to 0 to infinity, thereby making it suitable for the Poisson distribution. This means that we often need to do a back transformation when we interpret the parameter coefficients in the actual scale. For example, when using the log-link we would exponentiate the coefficients.\nSpecifying the exponential family\nTo specify the exponential family we add an additional argument in our model specification, family = sm.families.Binomial().

The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.\nThe Poisson distribution is given by the formula:\n\\[P(k\\ \\mathrm{events}) = \\frac{\\lambda^{k}e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\]\nWhere, \\(\\lambda\\) is the average density of the events (e.g. cyclists per day), and the function returns the likelihood of seeing \\(k\\) cyclists.\nIn some cases, such as in python, \\(\\lambda\\) (lambda) is refered to as \\(\\mu\\) (mu).\nFor bicycle counts, it allows us to generate estimates for the number of cyclists crossing the Brooklyn Bridge on any given day. We can do this by taking the mean number of cyclists per day, 2680, and by generating 10,000 samples from the poisson distribution:\n\n# generate the counts of the number of cyclists\n# mu is mean cyclists per day, size is 10000 samples.\nsim_counts = poisson.rvs(mu=2680, size=10000)\n\n# plot the counts through time\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 5))\nax.hist(sim_counts, bins=20, color='aquamarine')\n\n# add the line representing the mean counts\nax.axvline(sim_counts.mean(), linestyle='dashed', color='goldenrod')\n\n# add labels\nax.set_ylabel('Frequency')\nax.set_xlabel('Simulated Daily Number of Bicycles crossing the Brooklyn Bridge');\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance this looks reasonable, we’ve drawn a peaked distribution around our chosen \\(\\lambda\\). However, look a bit closer and you’ll see something is not right. The spread of the simulated poisson data doesn’t seem to be any where near the spread of our actual data.\nNotice that the Poisson distribution only has one parameter: \\(\\lambda\\) (aka \\(\\mu\\)), this parameter tells us where the peak of the distribution is located on the x axis. By comparison, the normal distribution has a similar parameter, \\(\\mu\\), which tells you where to locate the peak of the normal distribution. The normal distribution also has another parameter, \\(\\sigma\\), the standard deviation which specifies the spread of the data around \\(\\mu\\). Because the poisson distribution only has \\(\\lambda\\), an assumption is made that the variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\), of the data is equal to the mean (\\(\\lambda\\)), this assumption is called the “equi-dispersion” assumption. Effectively, for a poisson model to be appropriate, the variance = mean.\nWe can see that in the simulated data we produced above this is the case, the effect of having the variance equal to the mean is that the standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), of the count data is only 52 bicycles per day (\\(\\sqrt(2680)\\)). The actual data has a much greater spread and as a result a much higher variance.\n\n# mean and variance of simulated poisson data\nsim_counts.mean(), sim_counts.var()\n\n(np.float64(2680.3695), np.float64(2698.3587697499997))\n\n\n\n# mean and variance of cyclist data\nbikes['bb_count'].mean(), bikes['bb_count'].var()\n\n(np.float64(2680.042056074766), np.float64(730530.6601948136))\n\n\nWhile the simulated data obeys the equi-dispersion assumption, it is clear that our observed data does not. While we can happily fit a poisson regression to model our cyclist counts, the model will violate the equi-dispersion assumption and produce artificially small standard errors. This could lead to you attributing significance to model coefficients that aren’t, in reality, important."

    "text": "4.2 The Negative Binomial Distribution\nThe negative binomial distribution is a generalisation of the poisson distribution, whose variance is considered separately from its mean, and hence works well when data are overdispersed. The negative binomial is usually characterised in similar terms to the binomial distribution: \\(r\\) (number of failures observed) and \\(p\\) (probability of success), with \\(k\\) now representing the probability of seeing \\(k\\) successes before \\(r\\) failures are observed given \\(p\\).\nThis is how it is done in scipy.stats, however it can also be parameterised in terms of its mean and variance. As a result, the two do not have to be equal as with the Poisson distribution, and the negative binomial distribution can better represent the count data of interest.\n\\[p = \\frac{\\sigma^{2} - \\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}\\]\n\\[r = \\frac{\\mu^{2}}{\\sigma^{2} - \\mu}\\]\nGiving the Negative Binomial distribution as:\n\\[P(X = k) = \\left( \\begin{matrix}\nk + r - 1\\\\\nk\n\\end{matrix} \\right)p^{k} \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma^{2}}  \\right)^{r} \\]\nWhere:\n\\(p\\) is the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial with two outcomes (success or failure);\n\\(r\\) is the dispersion or shape parameter;\n\\(k\\) is the given number of successes of interest.\nWe can parameterise a negative binomial distribution based on the mean and variance of the observed bicycle count data.\nNote that although commonly called \\(r\\), scipy refers to this parameter as \\(n\\).\nWe can calculate these values directly from the data using:\n\n# Calculate the probability of success, p, in a Bernoulli trial\np = (bikes['bb_count'].var() - bikes['bb_count'].mean()) / bikes['bb_count'].var()\np\n\nnp.float64(0.9963313763513224)\n\n\n\n# Calculate the dispersion or shape parameter, r. \nr = (bikes['bb_count'].mean() **2) / (bikes['bb_count'].var() - bikes['bb_count'].mean())\nr\n\nnp.float64(9.86826863003412)\n\n\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 7))\n\n# plot the counts of the data\nax.hist(bikes['bb_count'],\n        color='darkblue',\n        bins=15,\n        alpha=0.5,\n        density=True,\n        label='Observed Counts')\n\n# plot a negative binomial using the derived coefficient values\nax.plot(nbinom.pmf(np.arange(0, 5000), n=r, p=1-p),\n        color='darkorange',\n        label=\"Negative Binomial\")\n\n# plot a normal distribution using the mean and standard deviation from the data\n# not that we are using standard deviation not variance for this model\nax.plot(norm.pdf(np.arange(0, 5000), loc=bikes['bb_count'].mean(), scale=bikes['bb_count'].std()),\n        color='cyan',\n        label='Normal')\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Daily Number of Bicycles crossing the Brooklyn Bridge\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Density\")\nax.legend();\n\n\n\n\nThe negative binomial model is not an exact fit for the bicycle count data, however we don’t require it to be. We simply assume errors will follow a negative binomial distribution, the count of bicycle crossings can be a mix of distributions to be dealt with in the modelling phase to come.\nThe normal distribution is also often seen as a reasonable approximation for count data when the average value for count is high, the normal curve is also superimposed on the graph.\nIn general, the assumption that each ‘event’ (e.g. bicycle crossing the Brookyln Bridge) is independent is likely to be unlikely, but in the absence of any other information we’ll make this assumption."

    "text": "6.2 Is my Poisson model overdispersed?\nAs we’ve noted, the Poisson distribution assumes that the given mean is equal to the variance. If, in fact, our variance proves to be larger than the mean, we have overdispersed count data, which is inappropriate for the poisson model. Overdispersed data are inappropriate because they lead to an underestimation of the standard errors of our regression coefficients (these represent the precision or uncertainty of our coefficient estimates). Understated standard errors may lead us to believe that particular explanatory variables are significant in explaining our outcome of interest, when in reality they are not.\nA simple check for overdispersion is the dispersion statistic, which is given by:\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm{Pearson}\\ \\chi^{2}}{\\mathrm{Residual\\ Degrees\\ of\\ Freedom}}\\]\nWhen the data is drawn from a Poisson distribution, this value should be approximately 1. A ratio less than 1 implies underdispersion (i.e. variance < mean), and a value more than 1 implies overdispersion (i.e. variance > mean).\nData that is underdispersed often arises dues to excess zeros, resulting from a separate data generating mechanism and requires a zero-inflated model which first fits a logit/probit model for zeroes vs. counts, and then a count model on the counts.\nData that is overdispersed can be modelled using a negative binomial model or a quasi-poisson approach.\n\ndispersion_stat = poisson_glm.pearson_chi2 / poisson_glm.df_resid\ndispersion_stat\n\nnp.float64(265.564545236699)\n\n\nClearly from the dispersion statistic we’re deep in overdispersion territory!

    "text": "Course Overview\n\nChapter 1: Exploratory Data Analysis\nIn this chapter, we will delve into the principles of tidy data and explore the concepts of variables, values, and observations. Learners will use Python to analyze the structure of datasets and differentiate between continuous and categorical variables. We’ll examine the significance of variation and covariation in data and explore their roles within Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Visual tools will be leveraged to uncover patterns and relationships in data, enhancing our understanding of variable interactions.\n\n\nChapter 2 - Model Basics\nThis chapter introduces the foundations of statistical modeling. Learners will explore model families, fitted models, and the differences between response and explanatory variables. The process of constructing linear models in Python will be covered, with explanations of key components like slopes and intercepts. Learners will practice extracting parameters from model objects and interpreting tables generated by fitted models. Techniques for assessing model fit, including the use of residuals, Adjusted R-squared, and AIC for model comparison, will also be discussed.\n\n\nChapter 3 - Generalized Linear Models\nBuilding on the basics of linear modeling, this chapter introduces generalized linear models (GLMs). Learners will explore fundamental probability concepts, including random variables and probability distributions, with a focus on their application to real-world data. Common probability distributions, such as binomial, normal, Poisson, and negative binomial, will be discussed. Finally, we will implement generalized linear models in Python, demonstrating their flexibility in handling various types of response variables."
